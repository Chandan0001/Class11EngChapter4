        <h2 id="page1">A. Work in small groups and discuss these questions : </h2>
        <h5>1. Does democracy have anything to do with freedom?</h5>
        <p>Ans: Yes. Democracy without freedom is meaningless. Democracy means freedom of people to
            choose their government. For this they must have freedom of speech and freedom of
            movement with fear.
        </p>

        <h5>2.In democracy citizen’s role is of utmost importance. How ?</h5>
        <p>In democracy citizens have the power to choose their representatives. It is very important
            that they use this power most judiciously. They should also see that their representatives are
            doing their duty in the right way.</p>

        <h5>3. Why are fundamental rights important to us?</h5>

        <p>A citizens has fundamental rights. They are important to be a free citizen of a country. If a
            person has no fundamental rights he is not a citizen. He/she is a slave.</p>

        <h5>4. Have you ever wondered what keeps the traffic move smoothly without running into one
            another?</h5>
        <p>Yes, I know it moves smoothly because it obeys the rule of the road. If vehicles and
            pedestrians did not obey the rule of the road, there would be confusion and accidents.</p>

        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2 id="page2">B. 1. Answer the following questions briefly:</h2>
        <h5>1. Why did the old lady refuse to walk on the pavement?</h5>
        <p>She refused to walk on the pavement because she believed she had got the liberty to walk
            where she liked.</p>

        <h5>2. How did she cause a chaos?</h5>
        <p>By walking in the middle of the road she disobeyed the rule of the road and caused
            confusion. Everybody was getting in everybody else’s way.</p>
        <h5>3. How has the author defined liberty?</h5>

        <p>The author has defined liberty as a social contract. It is an adjustment of interests.</p>


        <h5>4. ‘You have submitted to a curtailment of private liberty in order that you man enjoy a social
            order which makes your liberty a reality.’ What does the author mean?</h5>
        <p>Liberty is not entirely a private matter. We live in society. So no man’s liberty should take
            away another man’s liberty. By so doing everybody will enjoy a social order and peace.</p>

        <h5>5. What is the ‘danger’ the author is referring to in paragraph 2?</h5>
        <p>The author is referring to the danger of a chaos like the one the old lady caused by disobeying
            the rule of the road. If everybody wants unlimited liberty, there will be chaos.</p>

        <h5>6. How is liberty a social contract?</h5>
        <p>Liberty is a social contract in the sense that no individual will trample over the liberty of
            anyone else.</p>

        <h2 id="page3">B. 2. Answer the following questions briefly:</h2>
        <h5>1. Are the rights of the people less important than the rights of the nations?</h5>
        <p>No. The rights of the people are as important as the rights of the nations.</p>

        <h5>2. Why couldn’t the author read his book during his rail journey?</h5>
        <p>He could not read his book because one of the passengers was talking to his friend in a loud
            and pompous voice.</p>

        <h5>3. What does the author want to convey through the illustration of a trombone?</h5>
        <p>The author wants to say that everybody has a right to enjoy themselves so long as they do not
            disturb others.</p>

        <h5>4. What two types of reading does the author refer to ? How are they different?</h5>
        <p>The author refers to reading for pleasure and reading as a task. The two are different. You
            won’t mind noise if you are reading for pleasure. But if you are reading as a task, you will
            expect reasonable quiet.</p>
        <h5>5. List the actions for which we “ask no one’s leave”.</h5>
        <p>Some of the actions referred to in the lesson are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Walking down a street in a dressing gown</li>
            <li>Wearing long hair</li>
            <li>Walking barefoot</li>
            <li>Dyeing one’s hair</li>
            <li>Waxing one’s moustache</li>
            <li>Wearing tall hat, frock coat and sandals</li>
            <li>Going to bed late</li>
            <li>Getting up early, etc</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="page4">C. 1. Long Answer Questions:</h2>

        <h5>1. What does the rule of the road mean ? Give examples to show how necessary it is to preserve
            order in society.</h5>

        <p>The rule of the road means the regulations concerning the smooth and orderly movement of
            vehicles and pedestrians on roads without causing accidents. For example, in India we are
            supposed to keep to our left. If we want to overtake a vehicle or a pedestrian, we must do it
            from the right side. In cities, there are different lanes for pedestrians, light vehicles and
            heavy vehicles, so that no accidents take place. On crossroads there is a policeman or signal
            lights to regulate the traffic. When the policemen raises his hand or the red light is on, every
            vehicle must stop so that vehicles from the other channel may move</p>

        <p>Sometimes some people do not care for these rules because they are in a hurry. But they are
            likely to cause confusion and accidents. Then hurry proves to be very costly. So these rules
            are meant to help people and not to harass them. The rules are meant for all. If somebody
            does not obey these rules, no body will follow them. Then there will be confusion and
            anarchy</p>

        <h5>2. Who, according to A. G. Gardiner, is a civilized man?</h5>
        <p>A man who is conscious of his conduct, so as not to interfere in the liberty of his neighbours
            is a truly civilised man. A civilised man obeys the rules even in small matters. A man is at
            liberty to enjoy and recreate himself in his house. But a civilised man makes sure that his
            enjoyment does not interfere with the right of his neighbour to enjoy himself. It does not
            need doing great – and heroic deeds that makes a man civilised. It is his conduct in small
            matters of daily life that shows whether a man is civilised or uncivilised</p>

        <h5>3. Unchecked personal liberty would lead to social anarchy. Elaborate giving examples</h5>

        <p>Unchecked personal liberty is neither feasible nor desirable. If everybody had their way to do
            what they liked, there would be chaos. Let us take the example of the traffic on the public
            highway. Everybody has a right to use it. But if there were no rules, every one would like to
            walk or drive in the middle of the road. These,,would be collisions not only between vehicles
            coming from opposite side, but even between slow and fast moving vehicles moving in the
            same direction. Even now we see that whenever people flout the rule of the road there are
            jams and accidents. In our daily life we will have no peace. If someone liked to use a loud
            speaker, his neighbour may have no rest. Students will not be able to concentrate on their
            studies, or everybody will try to outdo the other in making a noise. That is why there are laws
            to curtail individual freedom to the extent that there is order in society</p>

        <h5>4. “Our personal liberty of action is restricted by other
            people’s liberty.” How ? Give three examplse.
        </h5>

        <p>As A. G. Gardiner has rightly pointed out, liberty is not an entirely personal affair. It is a
            social contract. It is an adjustment of interests. If a person has his liberty, so do others. So we
            all have to reach a compromise. Everybody agrees to curtail their liberty so that others may
            enjoy their liberty. For example, a passenger in a train has the liberty to talk to his friend. But
            another passenger has a right to do some serious reading. So the former passenger should
            not speak so loudly that the other passenger is unable to concentrate. A person wants to
            listen to songs on his radio at night. He has an absolute right to do so. But he must see that
            his enjoyment does not disturb his neighbours.</p>

        <p>Similarly, while walking or driving on the road we should let others drive and walk too. No
            one has a right to block the road and hinder other from using the road. He has to walk or
            drive in such a way that others may enjoy their liberty and use it also.</p>

        <h5>5. How can we enjoy personal liberty and also respect the liberty of our neighbours ? Give
            examples.</h5>

        <p>We live in a civilised society and we enjoy some rights. We are free citizens and not slaves.
            Our freedom and rights are protected by our Constitution. But being civilised citizens, we
            have some duties also. We have a right to life. So do all the people. So we must respect the
            others’ right to life also. It is our duty to see that our enjoyment of our liberty does not
            interfere with other’s. No doubt there are so many things that we can do as we please without
            causing inconvenience to others. We can dress ourselves the way we like.</p>

        <p>But we should not make so much noise as to disturb others. If a person wants to smoke, it is
            his personal choice. He can smoke at home. But he should see that his smoking in a bus or a
            public place does not offend or harm others. Whether there is a law or no law against an.
            action, a civilised person respects the feelings of his neighbours and respects their liberty by
            restraining himself.</p>

        <h5>6. A reasonable consideration for the rights or feelings of others is the foundation of social
            conduct. How</h5>

        <p>No elaborate laws can be made to regulate our social conduct. Our social conduct is governed
            by traditions and personal behaviour. For example, someone in my neighbour’s family is
            seriously ill. There is no law to stop me from celebrating my birthday with fun and frolic. But
            being a good neighbour, I must have a reasonable consideration for the feelings of my
            neighbour. I should tone down my celebrations in such a way that my neighbours feelings are
            not hurt. There are so many things that we can do, or avoid doing, just not to hurt others’
            feelings. Sometimes there are riots between two groups or communities over trifles which
            can be avoided. If they have reasonable consideration for each others’ feelings, many
            quarrels and conflicts can easily be avoided</p>

        <h2 id="page5">C. 2. Group Discussion:</h2>
        <h5>Question a.
            What makes life a pleasant experience : the awareness of one’s rights or consciousness of
            one’s duties?</h5>
        <p> Rights and duties go hand in hand. If a person is not aware of his rights, he/she is
            likely to be exploited. In olden days, traders exploited consumers. Now consumers have the
            right to get what he/she pays for. So he/ she can have his/her rights enforced through
            consumer courts. Awareness of one’s rights is important in life</p>

        <p>Duties are as important as our rights. Often people want to enjoy their rights but ignore their
            duties. To keep the environment clean is the duty of every citizen. To stop an illegal activity is
            the duty of not only the police but every citizen’s duty also. Even our Constitution has
            assigned certain duties to the citizens. If we want life to be a pleasant experience, we must do
            our duty to society, to our institution, to our family, to our nation and to the whole humanity</p>

        <h5>Question b.
            Little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</h5>
        <p>In our times knowledge is so enormous that we can hope to get only a little of it.
            Unless we have a little knowledge about everything we cannot use it. So a little knowledge
            about how to keep fit, how to use the computer, how to drive and how to travel is useful. But
            sometimes we try to use our little knowledge in such a way as if we know all. We may have a
            little knowledge of medicines. But to act as a doctor to oneself or to others can be dangerous</p>

        <h2 id="page6">C. 3. Composition:</h2>
        <h5>Write a paragraph in about 100 words on each of the following:</h5>
        <h5>Question a.
            Duties of a citizen:</h5>
        <p>A citizen, has his duties. Our Constitution has assigned some fundamental duties to all
            citizens of India. Every citizen should try to keep the environment clean. He/she should try
            to protect forests and not to degrade them. Our rivers and water bodies are getting polluted.
            It is the duty of every citizen to avoid polluting them. They should not dump garbage etc. into
            them. There are several monuments in our country. They are our national heritage. Every
            citizen should protect them from being vandalised. Public ‘ property like trains, buildings,
            buses, parks are for our welfare. We should protect them. All of in should try to be kind to
            animals. We should be good citizens and respect the feelings and practices, of all people to
            whatever religion, region or sex they belong to. Above all we should try to improve our
            personality and character to be able to serve our nation better</p>

        <h5>Question b.
            Role of police in civil society</h5>

        <p>Every modem civil society needs police for the enforcement of laws and to help the law￾abiding citizens. The
            police is needed to maintain law and order. They keep watch on illegal
            and immoral activities and bring the culprits to book. But the police should help the people,
            and it should be fair and free from corruption. The police force should behave and act in a
            manner that even the poorest and the most helpless person feels free to ask for help. Police is
            meant to help the citizens and not to harass them. Police should be free from any pressures
            so that it can work independently without fear or favour</p>
