        <h2 id="page1">A. Work in small groups and discuss these questions : </h2>
        <h5>1. Does democracy have anything to do with freedom?</h5>
        <p>Ans: Yes. Democracy without freedom is meaningless. Democracy means freedom of people to
            choose their government. For this they must have freedom of speech and freedom of
            movement with fear.
        </p>

        <h5>2.In democracy citizen’s role is of utmost importance. How ?</h5>
        <p>In democracy citizens have the power to choose their representatives. It is very important
            that they use this power most judiciously. They should also see that their representatives are
            doing their duty in the right way.</p>

        <h5>3. Why are fundamental rights important to us?</h5>

        <p>A citizens has fundamental rights. They are important to be a free citizen of a country. If a
            person has no fundamental rights he is not a citizen. He/she is a slave.</p>

        <h5>4. Have you ever wondered what keeps the traffic move smoothly without running into one
            another?</h5>
        <p>Yes, I know it moves smoothly because it obeys the rule of the road. If vehicles and
            pedestrians did not obey the rule of the road, there would be confusion and accidents.</p>

        <h2 id="page2">B. 1. Answer the following questions briefly:</h2>
        <h5>1. Why did the old lady refuse to walk on the pavement?</h5>
        <p>She refused to walk on the pavement because she believed she had got the liberty to walk
            where she liked.</p>

        <h5>2. How did she cause a chaos?</h5>
        <p>By walking in the middle of the road she disobeyed the rule of the road and caused
            confusion. Everybody was getting in everybody else’s way.</p>
        <h5>3. How has the author defined liberty?</h5>

        <p>The author has defined liberty as a social contract. It is an adjustment of interests.</p>


        <h5>4. ‘You have submitted to a curtailment of private liberty in order that you man enjoy a social
            order which makes your liberty a reality.’ What does the author mean?</h5>
        <p>Liberty is not entirely a private matter. We live in society. So no man’s liberty should take
            away another man’s liberty. By so doing everybody will enjoy a social order and peace.</p>

        <h5>5. What is the ‘danger’ the author is referring to in paragraph 2?</h5>
        <p>The author is referring to the danger of a chaos like the one the old lady caused by disobeying
            the rule of the road. If everybody wants unlimited liberty, there will be chaos.</p>

        <h5>6. How is liberty a social contract?</h5>
        <p>Liberty is a social contract in the sense that no individual will trample over the liberty of
            anyone else.</p>

        <h2 id="page3">B. 2. Answer the following questions briefly:</h2>
        <h5>1. Are the rights of the people less important than the rights of the nations?</h5>
        <p>No. The rights of the people are as important as the rights of the nations.</p>

        <h5>2. Why couldn’t the author read his book during his rail journey?</h5>
        <p>He could not read his book because one of the passengers was talking to his friend in a loud
            and pompous voice.</p>

        <h5>3. What does the author want to convey through the illustration of a trombone?</h5>
        <p>The author wants to say that everybody has a right to enjoy themselves so long as they do not
            disturb others.</p>

        <h5>4. What two types of reading does the author refer to ? How are they different?</h5>
        <p>The author refers to reading for pleasure and reading as a task. The two are different. You
            won’t mind noise if you are reading for pleasure. But if you are reading as a task, you will
            expect reasonable quiet.</p>
        <h5>5. List the actions for which we “ask no one’s leave”.</h5>
